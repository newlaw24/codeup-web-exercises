=====================================================
- while loop: do something an unknown number of times
 *   - do-while: if the thing needs to happen *at least* once
 * - for loop: when you want to loop a known number of times
 *
 * Break + Contiue:
 *
 * - break: prematurely stop a loop
 * - continue: skip a loop iteration

 4 parts of defining a function in js
 1st part is the world "function"

 ==========================
while loop is a basic looping construct that will execute a code block as long as a certain condition is true
do-while loop is only different from a while in that the condition is evaluated at the end of the loop instead of the beginning.
 Syntax:
 while (/*condition*/) {
     // body
 }

for (statement 1; statement 2; statement 3) {
    code block to be executed
}
Statement 1 is executed before the loop (the code block) starts.

Statement 2 defines the condition for running the loop (the code block).

Statement 3 is executed each time after the loop (the code block) has been executed
continues loop until coondition is met.
